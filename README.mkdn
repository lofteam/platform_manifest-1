Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/OmegaOS, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the OmegaOS trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/OmegaOS/platform_manifest.git -b n7.1

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
